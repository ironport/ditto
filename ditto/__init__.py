==================================================
Class mocking framework for use with unit testing
==================================================

Summary
=======

This module is meant to implement a "more" elegant class mocking framework for
python than what I can find by searching on Google. And by "elegant" I mean
more like Google's GMock. You might even say this is a port of GMock, although
I would say it's still got some pythonic flare.

How To Use
==========

Here's a general guide to how you can use the framework.

Instantiating Mock Instances
----------------------------

Given some class that you want to mock (call it ```Foo``), declare a *mocked*
instance of that class by doing the following::

    my_instance = Mock(Foo)

That is, pass the class that you want to mock to the constructor of ``Mock.``
It will automagically make ``my_instance`` have the same interface as ``Foo``,
except the methods will be mocked rather than real. (Note that there's no need
to ever define an actual class.) By default, all methods that don't feel like
python secret methods are mocked up. In other words, two mocked instances are
"equal" based on the ``__eq__`` method in the  ``Mock`` class. That method
isn't "mocked" based on seeing it in the original class. That's because
``__eq__`` isn't a method that will be mocked up by default. Mocking every
single method would essentially make ``Mock`` instances completely unusable,
because the mocks, themselves, lose most of their identity, and they still need
to exist as viable python objects.

The framework doesn't do a particularly good job of picking which methods to
mock and which to not, but that's actually not that big of a deal -- any
formula we choose would be bad in a certain set of cases. That's why we let you
define your own formula. If you'd like to control which methods get a mock or
not, just declare a function that decides this, and then register it when you
create your mock object::


    def pick_functions(class, method):
        return method in ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']

    my_instance = Mock(Foo, _method_selector=pick_functions)

As another example, the following function mocks every single method on a
mocked instance::

    def pick_functions(class, method_name):
        '''Return True if we should mock method_name in class'''
        return True

This example is not a useful one, though -- don't ever just return True.
``__class__`` is unmockable, because python will need that to actually point to
the ``Mock`` class. By the way, if you're trying to mock ``__class__`` you're
doing something wrong, so this isn't exactly a heinous restriction. It just
means there's no easy way to say "give me everything," because "everything" is
never a good idea.

Creating Expectations
---------------------

Rather than have the behavior you'd expect, each mocked method on a mocked
instance checks to make sure that we were expecting such a method call (this
method, these arguments, at this time) to happen. In order for it to make this
decision, you must give it a set of *expectations* to operate under.

To "expect" that a method on ``my_instance`` (call it ``bar``) will be called
with a given set of parameters (say ``1, 2, 3``), do the following::

    my_instance.foo.expect(1, 2, 3)

If you don't do this, calling the method (at this time) will not be expected,
and will raise an ``AssertionError``. (Note that the appropriate way to assert
that a method should never be called is to never call its ``expect`` method.)
The above snippet tells the mock framework to expect the following::

    my_instance.foo(1, 2, 3)

but only with these arguments. Any other arguments will be unexpected, and will
raise an ``AssertionError``.

Expectations *retire* when they've been satisfied. The mock framework holds a
list of all the expectations that are still waiting to be satisfied. At the end
of your program's run, you might want to assert that there are no more
expectations waiting to be met. This is a way of asserting that your code under
test *actually did* all the stuff you wanted it to do.

In order to do this, you need to understand *contexts*. When you create a
``Mock`` instance, as demonstrated above, the framework will create that
instance in the *default* context. Expectations created off that mock instance
will be added to the list of expectations in that default context. The default
context is a singleton, which can be accessed as follows::

    from ditto import default_context

There are two useful functions to use on a context.
``assert_no_more_expectations()`` will raise ``AssertionError`` if your test code
hasn't met all the expectations you've created. ``retire_all_expectations()``
clears the list, so that you can start a new round of testing.

If you'd like to separate expectations into multiple contexts, so that you can
assert that different sets of expectations have been met at different points
during your test, you can specify custom contexts by doing the following::

    c1 = Context()
    c2 = Context()

    m1 = Mock(Foo, _context=c1)
    m2 = Mock(Foo, _context=c2)

Obviously you can operate on ``c1`` and ``c2`` just like you can on
``default_context``.

Expecting Indefinite Arguments
------------------------------

Brittle tests suck. It's probably the case that you'll have to go tweak
something in a unit test when you modify the code that it tests, but we'd like
that to be as little as is reasonable. One way of helping with this is to
create expectations that are only as explicit as is required for the code to be
considered correct. (As an example, if your HTTP proxy starts tacking on an
``X-Foo`` header, and that header really isn't important, make sure your
relevant mocked classes won't fail when it starts to add that header.)

It might be the case, for instance, that all you really care about is that a
method is called with any arguments, or with three arguments, or that these
arguments are all strings, or that these string arguments all have the
substring "foo" in them.

To express such inexact expectations, use Hamcrest matchers.
``python-hamcrest`` is a literal port of the Java-based Hamcrest library into
Python. Think of these matchers as "regular expressions" for all different
kinds of python values (not just strings).

To use, wrap any hamcrest matcher instance in the ``matches()`` function from
this module::

    my_instance.foo.expect(matches(hamcrest.less_than(3)))

You can also wrap *any* instance that declares the method
``matches(other_thing)`` with ``matches()``, not just those found in hamcrest.

Changing Expectations
---------------------

By default, expectations retire after being satisfied a single time, can happen
in any order, and return ``None`` to the caller when they're satisfied. You can
change all of these things by calling various methods on an expectation
instance, which ``expect()`` returns::

    my_instance.foo.expect().returns(23).times(3).optional()
    my_instance.foo.expect().raises(Exception).infinite_times()

You can set whether an expectation returns a value or raises an error by using
``returns`` and ``raises``. You can make ``assert_no_more_expectations`` skip
over your expectation by using ``optional``. You can set the number of times
you want your expectation have to be met before it retires using ``times`` (or
you can make it never retire by using ``infinite_times``.

Another important way you can change an expectation is by putting it in a
sequence. By default, expectations that are active are active *for all possible
method calls in your context*. That is, it doesn't really matter what order you
created the expectations in. Obviously you might want to test that the order of
method calls in your code follows a tighter restriction. Do this by dropping
expectations into *sequences*::

    s = Sequence()
    my_instance.foo.expect(5).in_sequence(s)
    my_instance.foo.expect(6).in_sequence(s)

This asserts that the expectation of ``foo`` being called with ``6`` is only
active *after* the expectation that ``foo`` is called with ``5`` *retires*. In
other words, you have to call them in the order of the sequence for the test to
pass.

You can put expectations in more than one sequence, and you can put
expectations from more than one mocked object into the same sequence::

    s1 = Sequence()
    s2 = Sequence()

    # Expectation A
    my_instance.foo.expect(5).in_sequence(s1)

    # Expectation B
    my_other_instance.foo.expect(6).in_sequence(s1).in_sequence(s2)

    # Expectation C
    my_other_instance.bar.expect(6).in_sequence(s1)

    # Expectation D
    my_instance.bar.expect(8).in_sequence(s2)

This declares two sequences that, together, contain four expectations (labeled
A, B, C, D). Those sequences, if I were to print them out, would look like
this::

    s1 = (A, B, C,)
    s1 = (B, D,)

For this context, those are the only two sequences of expectations that will
result in a passing test. The framework will throw an error as soon as there's
no situation that could possibly result in a passing test. For instance, D
before anything else, or A followed by D, or B followed by C. It doesn't have
to get to the very end to realize that there's no way the test can pass. This
is useful because it helps make the traceback from the actual problematic call
site visible.

Applicative Declaration
-----------------------

Often, it's very useful to declare test data inside a huge applicative python
structure. Here's an example::

    my_data = [
        {'id': 1,
         'segment': Mock(Segment),}
    ]

It's really hard to do that if you have to go back and set expecations on all
the mock objects inside such a huge structure. In the above example, it would
appear, on the surface, that I might have to write code that iterates through
my huge structure, finds all the mock objects, and individually declares
expectations on them. Or, maybe I'd have to just delegate to some function::

    # XXX: This is NOT the way to do it!!
    def create_segment():
        m = Mock(PdtsSeg)
        m.send.expect().times(5)
        m.send_new_data.expect(matches(anything)).times(3)

        return m

    my_data = [
        {'id': 1,
         'segment': create_segment(),}
    ]


The solution this framework proposes can be colloquially described as "using
back pointers." Expectations point to their methods with the ``method`` attribute,
and methods point to their mock instance with the ``mock`` keyword. And every
method on an expectation returns the expectation right back to you. So you can
stack calls, like so::

    # XXX: Wow, that's a lot better.
    my_data = [
        {'id': 1,
         'segment':
              Mock(PdtsSeg).send.expect().times(5).method.mock \\
                           .send_new_data(matches(anything)).times(3).method.mock
        }
    ]

So what does all of this mean? It's entirely possible that every single mock
instance you'll ever create can be created with a *single python expression*,
and without having to declare a class. Beat that, googlemock. ;)

To Do
=====

There's still a bunch to do.

    - Currently, you have to manually retire expectations and check that all
      expectations were met. Surely there's a better way.
    - Should there be an easy way to make expectations from the same mocked
      instance go into different contexts?

    In cases where it's required that the *class* define a method (and not just
    the instance), you have to call this function to make sure Mock's state
    gets changed accordingly. This is rare.

    This situation most often arises when you'd like to mock the behavior of a
    "protocol" method (something with underscores). Those methods can't be
    dynamically overridden. They have to live on the class.

    Be warned:
      This method will pretty much let you override anything. Don't be stupid.
      Don't feel the need to override __str__ just to get it mockable to prove
      that your to-strings are getting called. It's probably not worth it. The
      best example of when you should use something like that is __enter__ and
      __exit__ on a mock that's used with the "with" keyword.
